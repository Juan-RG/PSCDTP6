## Introduction

**Linda Project** is a university project designed to simulate the behavior of the [Linda coordination language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)) protocol. Linda is a model of communication and synchronization between parallel processes, using a shared tuple space as a coordination medium. 

This project aims to implement and showcase the key features of the Linda protocol, including tuple creation, tuple space management, and inter-process communication.
